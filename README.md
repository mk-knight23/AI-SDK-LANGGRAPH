# AI-SDK-LANGGRAPH

Durable state-machine agents for long-running mission flows.

## Current Features

- Typed GraphState contract for mission execution.
- Route, planning, and verification graph nodes.
- FastAPI service and CLI runner.
- Shared skill registry and mission plan rendering.
- Docker, CI, pytest contract tests, and deployment-ready metadata.

## Existing Runtime Flow

1. A user sends a mission through the CLI or `POST /run`.
2. The shared Agents Army router scores the mission against agent skills.
3. The adapter selects a primary agent and support agents.
4. The LangGraph integration validates the framework-specific execution path.
5. The response returns routing, support agents, result text, and verification notes.

## SDK-Specific Implementation

Builds a StateGraph with route, plan, and verify nodes, then invokes the compiled graph.

## Repository Structure

- `app.py`: framework adapter and mission execution entrypoint.
- `api.py`: FastAPI health and run endpoints.
- `runner.py`: local CLI demo runner.
- `core/agents_army_core/`: shared routing, mission models, registry, and instruction rendering.
- `tests/`: contract tests for routing and verification behavior.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: automated pytest checks.
- `Dockerfile`: container packaging for API deployment.
- `SKILLSET.md`: skills represented by this SDK adapter.

## Run Locally

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 runner.py --mission "build secure api, add tests, and deploy"
```

## Run As An API

```bash
uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mission":"secure audit and deploy an AI workflow"}'
```

## Test

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

## Required Skill Set

See `SKILLSET.md` for the full skill matrix. At a high level this repository demonstrates:

- LangGraph integration.
- Agent routing and mission planning.
- API design with clear input/output contracts.
- CI-backed verification.
- Secure environment-based configuration.

## Upgrade Roadmap

- Add checkpoints for durable runs.
- Add human approval gates for risky tools.
- Create graph benchmarks for latency, recovery, and correctness.

## Clean Repository Policy

Generated files such as `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, local `.env` files, and dependency folders are ignored. Source, docs, tests, and deployment assets are intentionally kept in the repository.
